# SDES Message encryption/decryption
Python algorythm that utilizes Simplified Data Encryption Standard (SDES) for encrypting or decrypting plaintext messages into bits utilizing the 10-bit key.

It asks for an especification of the type of input(plaintext, bytes, or encrypted plaintext), and outputs accordingly.

This is a rewrite of an algorithm I wrote for schoolwork, with slightly better readability
